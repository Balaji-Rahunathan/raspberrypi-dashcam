# Raspberry Pi Dashcam Project

![Raspberry Pi Dashcam](dashcam.jpg)

The Raspberry Pi Dashcam project is a simple solution for recording footage using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and a wide-angle camera module. This project allows you to record videos, manage storage, view system information, and even create a Wi-Fi hotspot if the Raspberry Pi is not connected to a Wi-Fi network.

## Features

- Record footage of customizable length.
- Videos are stored with timestamps in MP4 format.
- Automatically delete old recordings to manage storage.
- Videos are recorded in 1080x1920 resolution using a wide-angle camera module.
- Start a Wi-Fi hotspot if the Raspberry Pi is not connected to Wi-Fi.
- Web dashboard for settings, system information, and video playback.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (or any Raspberry Pi with Wi-Fi capability)
- Raspberry Pi compatible wide-angle camera module
- Python 3
- Flask
- psutil

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Hardware Setup

Connect the wide-angle camera module to your Raspberry Pi.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-flask python3-psutil
```

### 3. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dashcam_project.git
cd dashcam_project
```

### 4. Modify Configuration (Optional)

You can modify settings like video length, hotspot SSID, and password in the `dashcam.py` script.

### 5. Set up the systemd Service

Create a systemd service file for the dashcam:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/dashcam.service
```

Paste the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=Raspberry Pi Dashcam Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/thunder/dashcam_project/dashcam.py
WorkingDirectory=/home/thunder/dashcam_project
StandardOutput=file:/var/log/dashcam.log
StandardError=file:/var/log/dashcam_error.log
Restart=always
User=thunder

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### 6. Reload and Start the Service

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start dashcam.service
sudo systemctl enable dashcam.service
```

## Usage

- Access the dashboard by connecting to the Raspberry Pi's IP address and port number (default: `http://<pi_ip>:5000`).
- Change settings like video length and view system information from the dashboard.
- Recorded videos are stored in the `/home/thunder/videos` directory.
- You can watch recorded videos and manage storage from the dashboard.

## Customization

- You can customize video resolution, hotspot settings, and other parameters in the `dashcam.py` script according to your requirements.
- Modify the HTML templates in the `templates` directory to change the dashboard layout and appearance.

## Troubleshooting

- If the service fails to start, check the logs using `sudo journalctl -u dashcam.service`.
- Ensure correct permissions and paths are set in the systemd service file and the Python script.
- Verify that the Raspberry Pi has access to the required hardware components and network interfaces.

## Credits

This project is based on Flask and psutil libraries and is inspired by various Raspberry Pi dashcam projects available online.

Replace `<pi_ip>` with the actual IP address of your Raspberry Pi. Also, replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username if you intend to host the project on GitHub.
